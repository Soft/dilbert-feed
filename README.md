The official [Dilbert](http://dilbert.com) Atom feed does not contain embedded
images but instead just provides links to the comics. This makes for a subpar
experience when accessing the feed through a feed reader. This tool remedies the
situation by fetching the official feed and generating a new one with the images
include directly into the content.
